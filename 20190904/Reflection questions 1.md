# Introduction to Relational Databases

Respond to the following reflection questions.

1. Why is it important to have a good understanding of the underlying business when creating a data model?

Without a design method that results in a well thought out data model then you’ll end up with a database that will not meet user requirements in the short and long term.



2. Compare and contrast data and metadata.

The main difference between data and metadata is that data is simply the content that can be a description of something, reading, measurements, observations, report anything. On the other hands, metadata describes the relevant information about the data. ... But, metadata is considered as processed data.

3. What is the difference between an entity and an attribute?

An entity is an object in RDBMS that is used to model and store information while an attribute is a characteristic to define an entity. Thus, this is the main difference between Entity and Attribute.

4. What is a primary key?

A primary key is a special relational database table column (or combination of columns) designated to uniquely identify all table records. A primary key's main features are: It must contain a unique value for each row of data. It cannot contain null values.

5. What is a foreign key?

A foreign key is a column or group of columns in a relational database table that provides a link between data in two tables. It acts as a cross-reference between tables because it references the primary key of another table, thereby establishing a link between them.

6. What is the purpose of relationships in a relational database?

A relationship, in the context of databases, is a situation that exists between two relational database tables when one table has a foreign key that references the primary key of the other table. Relationships allow relational databases to split and store data in different tables, while sharing data items.

7. What does a row represent in a relational database?

In the context of a relational database, a row—also called a tuple—represents a single, implicitly structured data item in a table. In simple terms, a database table can be thought of as consisting of rows and columns.
