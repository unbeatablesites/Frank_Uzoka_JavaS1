1. In your own words, write a few paragraphs comparing and constrasting these approaches. Which implementation is "best?" Feel free to create an `main` method and test out each, if you feel that helps your understanding.


Interface implementation is more of a blueprint for you classes. It's used to implement a class and does not utilize variables. They usually contain static members and method signatures. interface implementation is more of a declaration.

Abstract implementation is similar to Interface implementation. It is uses to set up the blue prints for classes. Abstract classes can extend other at most one abstract or concrete class and implement several interfaces.

Concrete Class Implementation takes class design a step further. It allows for class design, extensions, can be extended to, and can have variables.A concrete class is complete in itself and can extend and can be extended by any class. This implementation is more common amongst developers and is my preferred.
